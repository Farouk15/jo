						I have been preparing for this since 12/12 to 
						show you how much I care about you. <span>Bismillah,</span> it‚Äôs 2024, and it has been half a year since 
						I met you. <span>You are the best person I have known this year, and you are the best person I have
						ever known.</span>  A new year is coming, so enjoy, play, and take care of yourself. Don‚Äôt let people‚Äôs
						opinions affect you. I hope this year makes you a better person. I am proud because I have a lovely,
						majestic, and <span>pretty</span> woman (not a girl) by my side. I just want to tell you that my trust in you is back,
						stronger than before. Thank you for being in my life and providing confidence, support, attention, and <span>love</span> .
					    One day, we will wake up from sleeping together and say, ‚ÄòWe have suffered a lot for this moment. We did it.
						We were stupid for this worry.‚Äô It‚Äôs time to be together, and if time runs out and we stay far away from each 
						other, I just want you to know that <span>I love you forever.</span>  Thank you for coming into my life. You are actually making me smile and laugh.
					    Thank you for being so understanding. Thank you for being my biggest supporter, and thank you for caring about me. I really appreciate
						you so much. <span>I love you a lot</span> , and if loving you is wrong, I don‚Äôt want to be right because being right means being without you. Remember
						that souls don‚Äôt meet by accident, and <span>that‚Äôs why Allah made us meet.</span>  Stay confident that I will come to take you from your family to my hug,
						and don‚Äôt let overthinking and dark thoughts go through your brain. I wake up every day thanking Allah that I have you by my side. You‚Äôre my favorite smile,
						my favorite voice, my favorite face, and <span>my favorite person</span> . I am not going to stop praying for you, and I will not break my promise. I know you are afraid of
						losing me, but I will not tell you to trust me that I will come one day. But at least trust Allah. When you trust Him, <span>everything will be okay</span> , wallahi. Finally,
						start this year with a du3a2, <br> <br>sorry for my poor English.
